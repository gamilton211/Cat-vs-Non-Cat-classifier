## Cat-vs-Non-Cat-classifier
In this core implementation for Deep Learning invloved for Images/Image Processing Problems has been done. I followed Andrew Ng's *deeplearning.ai* Course for this.

In this first ipynb file named "Building your Deep Neural Network - Step by Step" contains all the function needed for basic ANN such as forward_activation_function, backward_functions etc.

So, that these implemented functions can be used for Cat vs Non-Cat application which is implemented in "Deep Neural Network - Cat vs Non-Cat"


## Data
Datasets has been loaded using h5 file for cats and non cats.
